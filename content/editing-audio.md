## Fade In/Fade Out

You may want to use the Fade In/Fade Out effect to make the transition from one sound to another more pleasant. Highlight the piece of audio that you want to fade using the Selection tool and then select **Effect → Fade In or Fade Out.**

## Exporting Audio

If you are creating something like a podcast, then you will probably want to export as an MP3 file.

To export, select **File → Export → Export as MP3**. Fill in as much information as you can in the metadata fields. This will be visible to podcast hosting platforms such as iTunes.

## Podcast Hosting

Once you’ve created your podcast, you’ll need to find a hosting platform so that your listeners can download your episodes. There are many different ones to choose from including Buzzsprout, Captivate or Libsyn. You might also choose to host your podcast on your website or blog if you have enough bandwidth.  

**Remember to include a transcript of your podcast with your episode so that it is as accessible as possible.**
